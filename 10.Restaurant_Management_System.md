### Design a Restaurant Management System

System will give the Restaurant management power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single portal. The system allows the manager to keep track of available tables in the system as well as the reservation of tables and bill generation.

#### System Requirements
1. The restaurant will have different branches.
2. Each restaurant branch will have a menu.
3. Each restaurant branch can have multiple seating arrangements of tables.
4. The system should be able to retrieve information about tables currently available to seat walk-in customers.
5. The system should support the reservation of tables.
6. The system should allow customers to cancel their reservation.
7. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation time is approaching.
8. The menu will have different menu sections, containing different menu items.
9. The waiter should be able to create an order for a table and add meals for each seat.
10. Each meal can have multiple meal items. Each meal item corresponds to a menu item.
11. The receptionist should be able to search for available tables by date/time and reserve a table.
12. The customers should be able to pay their bills through credit card, check or cash.

}

public class Address {
  private String streetAddress;

}
```

2. Different people that interact with our system: Account, Person, Employee, Receptionist, Manager, Chef

  String id;
  String password;

  public bool addEmployee() {}
}

class Chef extends Employee {
  public bool takeOrder() {}
