### Design a Car Rental System

#### System Requirements:
1. The system will support the renting of different automobiles like cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles.
2. The system should be able to retrieve information like which member took a particular vehicle.
3. The system should collect a late-fee for vehicles returned after the due date.
4. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation is approaching the pick-up date.
5. The system will be able to read barcodes from vehicles.
6. The system should maintain a vehicle log to track all events related to the vehicles.
7. Members should be able to search the vehicle inventory and reserve any available vehicle.
8. Members should be able to cancel their reservations.
9. Members can add rental insurance to their reservation.
10. Members can rent additional equipment, like navigation, child seat, ski rack, etc.
11. Members can add additional services to their reservation, such as roadside assistance, additional driver, wifi, etc.
12. Each vehicle should be added with a unique barcode and other details, including a parking stall number which helps to locate the vehicle.

#### Code
1. ENUMS

```
class Location {
    String streetAddress;
    String city;
    String state;
    String zipcode;
    String country;
}

class Person {
    String name;
    Address address;
    String email;
    String phone;
}
```
2. Actors

```
abstract class Account {
    int id;
    String password;
    AccountStatus status;
    Person person
    
    public bool resetPassword() {}
}

class Member extends Account {
    String driverLicenseNumber;
    Date driverLicenseExpiry;
    
    List<VehivleReservation> getReservations() {}
}

class Receptionist extends Account {
    Date dateJoined;
    
    bool searchMember() {}
}

class AdditionalDrive { 
    String driverID;
    Person person;
}
```

3. Top-Level Classes
```
class CarRentalSystem {
   String name;
   Location address;
   
   Address getLocation() {}
   
   bool addNewLocation() {}
}
```

4. Vehicle

```
class abstract Vehicle {
    String licenseNumber;
    String stockNumber;
    int passangerCapacity;
    String barcode;
    VehicleStatus status;
    String model;
    String make;
    int manufacturingYear;
    int mileage;
    
    bool reserveVehicle() {}
    
    bool returnVehicle() {}
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    CarType type;
}

class Van extends Vehicle {
    String type;
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
}

class VehicleReservation {}

```

5. Search

```

class SearchVehicleInventory {
    public static List<Vehicle> filterVehicle(List<Vehicle> vehicles, Predicate<Vehicle> predicate) {
        return vehicles.stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.<Vehicle>toList());
    }
}
```

6. Notification


7. Application

```
import static predicateExample.SearchVehicleInventory.*;
 public class CarRentalSystem {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Vehicle> vehicles = new ArrayList<>();
        try {
            Class.forName("com.mySQL.jdbc.Drive");
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);
            Statement smt = conn.createStatement();
            sql = "SELECT Vehicle * from VECHICLETABLE';
            ResultSet rs = smt.executeQuery(sql);
            
            while(rs.next()) {
                vehicles.add(rs.getString("Vehicle");
            }
        } catch(SQLException ex) {
        } finally {
            rs.close();
            smt.close();
            conn.close();
        }
        
        List<Vehicle> car_vehicles = filterVehicles(vehicles, VEHICLETYPE.CAR);
        List<Vehicle> sunroof_vehicles filterVehicles(car_vehicles, VEHICLEMODEL.SUNROOF);
    }
 }
