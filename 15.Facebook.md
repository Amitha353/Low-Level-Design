```
public abstract class Account {
  private String userName;
  private String password;
  private AccountStatus status;
  private Person person;
  
  public boolean resetPassword();
}

public class Person extends Account {
  private String name;
  private Address address;
  private String email;
  private String phone;
}

class Member extends Person {
  
}

class Admin extends Person {

}

class ConnectionInvitation {

}
```

3. Profile and Work: A memberâ€™s profile will have their work experiences, educations, places, etc:
```
class Profile {}

class Work {}
```

4. Page and Recommendation: Each page can have multiple recommendations, and members will follow/like pages:
```
class Page {}

class Recommendation {}
```

5. Group, Post, Message, and Comment: Members can create posts, comment on posts, send messages and join groups:
```
class Group {}

class Post {}

class Message {}

class Comment {}
```

6. Search
```
class SearchDirectory {
    List<Member> filterMembers(List<Members> members, Predicate<Member> predicate) {
          return members.stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.<Member>toList());
    }
    
    List<Group> filterGroups(List<Group> groups, Predicate<Group> predicate) {
          return groups.stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.<Group>toList());
    }
    
    List<Page> filterPages(List<Page> pages, Predicate<Page> predicate) {
          return pages.stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.<Page>toList());
    }
    
    List<Post> filterPosts(List<Post> posts, Predicate<Post> post) {
          return posts.stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.<Post>toList());
    }
    
    public static Predicate<Member> firstName(String name) {
        return m -> m.startsWith(name);
    }
}
```

7. SocialMediaSite 

```
class SocialMediaSite {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //User authenticate
        Person person = new Person(""name" , ...);
        person.isActive();
        
        //get the feeds - from database
        try {
            ResultSet rs = db.execute('select users_feed from user where username = ${person.name}');
            
            loadInfo(rs);
        }catch(SQLException ex) {
        } finally {
            conn.close();
        }
        
        List<Member> friends = filterMembers(members, firstName("Annie"));
        // search - UI is updated
        
    }
