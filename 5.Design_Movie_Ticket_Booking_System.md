### Design a Movie Ticket Booking System

An online movie ticket booking system facilitates the purchasing of movie tickets to its customers. E-ticketing systems allow customers to browse through movies currently playing and book seats, anywhere and anytime.

#### System Requirements
1. It should be able to list the cities where affiliate cinemas are located.
2. Each cinema can have multiple halls and each hall can run one movie show at a time.
3. Each Movie will have multiple shows.
4. Customers should be able to search movies by their title, language, genre, release date, and city name.
5. Once the customer selects a movie, the service should display the cinemas running that movie and its available shows.
6. The customer should be able to select a show at a particular cinema and book their tickets.
7. The service should show the customer the seating arrangement of the cinema hall. The customer should be able to select multiple seats according to their preference.
8. The customer should be able to distinguish between available seats and booked ones.
9. The system should send notifications whenever there is a new movie, as well as when a booking is made or canceled.
10. Customers of our system should be able to pay with credit cards or cash.
11. The system should ensure that no two customers can reserve the same seat
12. Customers should be able to add a discount coupon to their payment.

#### Actors
1. Admin: Responsible for adding new movies and their shows, canceling any movie or show, blocking/unblocking customers, etc.
2. FrontDeskOfficer: Can book/cancel tickets.
3. Customer: Can view movie schedules, book, and cancel tickets.
4. Guest: All guests can search movies but to book seats they have to become a registered member.
5. System: Mainly responsible for sending notifications for new movies, bookings, cancellations, etc.

#### Use Cases
1. Search movies: To search movies by title, genre, language, release date, and city name.
2. Create/Modify/View booking: To book a movie show ticket, cancel it or view details about the show.
3. Payment for booking: To pay for the booking.
4. Coupon to the payment: To add a discount coupon to the payment.
5. Assign Seat: Customers will be shown a seat map to let them select seats for their booking.
6. Refund payment: Upon cancellation, customers will be refunded the payment amount as long as the cancellation occurs within the allowed time frame.

#### Classes
1. Account: 3 Accounts
    - Admin will be able to add/remove movies and shows, as well as block/unblock accounts. 
    - Customers can search for movies and make bookings for shows. 
    - FrontDeskOffice can book tickets for movie shows.
2. Guest: Guests can search and view movies descriptions. To make a booking for a show they have to become a registered member.
3. Cinema: Name and Address.
4. CinemaHall: Each cinema will have multiple halls containing multiple seats.
5. City: Each city can have multiple cinemas.
6. Movie:  title, description, language, genre, release date, city name
7. Show:  Each movie can have many shows; each show will be played in a cinema hall.
8. CinemaHallSeat: Each cinema hall will have many seats.
9. ShowSeat: Each ShowSeat will correspond to a movie Show and a CinemaHallSeat. Customers will make a booking against a ShowSeat.
10. Booking: A booking is against a movie show and has attributes like a unique booking number, number of seats, and status.
11. Payment: Responsible for collecting payments from customers.
12. Notification: Will take care of sending notifications to customers.


#### Code

1. Enums, data types, and constants

```
public enum BookingStatus {
    REQUESTED, PENDING, CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN, CANCELED, ABANDONED;
}

public enum SeatType {
    REGULAR, PREMIUM, ACCESSIBLE, SHIPPED, EMERGENCY_EXIT, OTHER;
}

public enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, BLOCKED, BANNED, COMPROMISED, ARCHIVED, UNKNOWN;
}

public enum PaymentStatus {
    UNPAID, PENDING, COMPLETED, FILLED, DECLINED, CANCELLED, ABANDONED, SETTLING, SETTLED, REFUNDED;
}

public class Address {
  private String streetAddress;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private String zipCode;
  private String country;
}

```

2. Account, Customer, Admin, FrontDeskOfficer, and Guest
* These classes represent the different people that interact with our system

```
class Account {
  String id;
  String password;
  AccountStatus status; //active
  
  public boolean resetPassword();
}

class Person {
  String name;
  Address address;
  String email;
  String  phone;
  Account account;
}

class Customer extends Person {
  public void makeBooking(Booking booking) {
  }
  
  public List<Booking> getBooking() {}
}

class Admin extends Person {
  public void addMovie(Movie movie) {}
  
  public void addShow(Show show) {}
  
  public void blockUser(Person person) {}
}

class FrontDeskOfficer extends Person {
  public void createBooking(Booking booking) {}
  
}

class Guest {
  public Account registerAccount() {}
}
```

3. Show and Movie: A movie will have many shows

```
class Show {
  int showId;
  Date createdOn;
  DateTime startTime
  DateTime endTime;
  String playedAt;
  Movie movie;
}

class Movie {
  String title;
  String description;
  int durationInMins;
  String language;
  DateTime releaseDate;
  String country;
  String genre;
  Show[] shows;
}

```

4. Booking, ShowSeat, and Payment: Customers will reserve seats with a booking and make a payment

```
class Booking {
  String bookingNumber;
  int numberOfSeats;
  Date createdOn;
  BookingStatus status;
  
  public boolean cancel() {}
  
  public void make Payment(Payment payment) {}
  
  public int assignSeat(Showseat seats) {}
}

class ShowSeat {
  int seatNumber;
  bool isReserved;
  double price;
}

class Payment {
  double amount;
  Date createdOn;
  PaymentStatus status;
  int transactionId;
}

```

5. City, Cinema, CinemaHall and CinemaHallSeat: Each city can have many cinemas and each cinema can have many cinema halls:

```
class City {
  String name;
  String state;
  String zipCode;
}

class Cinema {
  String name;
  int totalCinemaHalls;
  Address location;
}

class CinemaHall {
  String name;
  int totalSeats;
}

class CinemaHallSeat {
  int seatId
  SeatType type;
}

```

6. Search interface and Catalog: Catalog will implement Search to facilitate searching of products.

```
public interface Search {
  public List<Movie> searchByTitle(String title);
  public List<Movie> searchByLanguage(String language);
  public List<Movie> searchByGenre(String genre);
  public List<Movie> searchByRelDate(Date relDate);
  public List<Movie> searchByCity(City city);  
}

public class Catalog implements Search {
  private HashMap<String, List<Movie>> movieTitles;
  private HashMap<String, List<Movie>> movieLanguage;
  private HashMap<String, List<Movie>> movieGenre;
  private HashMap<String, List<Movie>> movieRelDate;
  private HashMap<String, List<Movie>> movieCity;

  public List<Movie> searchByTitle(String query) {
    return movieTitles.get(query);
  }

  public List<Movie> searchByLanguage(String query) {
    return movieLanguage.get(query);
  }
}
```
7. Concurrency
* How to handle concurrency; such that no two users are able to book the same seat?

We can use transactions in SQL databases to avoid any clashes. For example, if we are using SQL server we can utilize Transaction Isolation Levels to lock the rows before we update them. Note: within a transaction, if we read rows we get a write-lock on them so that they can’t be updated by anyone else. Here is the sample code:

```
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
 
    -- Suppose we intend to reserve three seats (IDs: 54, 55, 56) for ShowID=99 
    Select * From ShowSeat where ShowID=99 && ShowSeatID in (54, 55, 56) && isReserved=0 
 
    -- if the number of rows returned by the above statement is NOT three, we can return failure to the user.
    update ShowSeat table...
    update Booking table ...
 
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
‘Serializable’ is the highest isolation level and guarantees safety from Dirty, Nonrepeatable, and Phantoms reads.
Once the above database transaction is successful, we can safely assume that the reservation has been marked successfully and no two customers will be able to reserve the same seat.
