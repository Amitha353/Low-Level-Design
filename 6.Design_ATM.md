### Design an ATM
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller.

#### System Requirements
* ATM Component
1. Card reader: to read the users’ ATM cards.
2. Keypad: to enter information into the ATM e.g. PIN. cards.
3. Screen: to display messages to the users.
4. Cash dispenser: for dispensing cash.
5. Deposit slot: For users to deposit cash or checks.
6. Printer: for printing receipts.
7. Communication/Network Infrastructure: it is assumed that the ATM has a communication infrastructure to communicate with the bank upon any transaction or activity.

* 2 types of accounts -> Checking & -> Saving
1. Balance inquiry: To see the amount of funds in each account.
2. Deposit cash: To deposit cash.
3. Deposit check: To deposit checks.
4. Withdraw cash: To withdraw money from their checking account.
5. Transfer funds: To transfer funds to another account.

#### Actors
1. Operator - tursn ATM on/off, refills atm with cash, refills atm's printer with ink, take out deposited cash and check.
2. Customer - Balance Inquiry, Cash Withdrawal, Deposit funds, Transfer funds.
3. Bank Manager - Generate report to check total deposits,check total withdrawals, remaining cash in ATM.

#### CLasses

4. Keypad
5. Screen
6. Printer
7. DepositSlot
8. Bank
9. Account
10. Customer
11. Card
12. Transaction

#### Code

##### 1. Enums and Constants

```
public enum TransactionType {
    BALANCE_INQUIRY, DEPOSIT_CASH, DEPOSIT_CHECK, WITHDRAW, TRANSFER;
}

public enum TransactionStatus {
    SUCCESS, FAILURE, BLOCKED, FULL, PARTIAL, NONE;
}

public enum CustomerStatus :
    ACTIVE, BLOCKED, BANNED, COMPROMISED, ARCHIVED, CLOSED, UNKNOWN;
}

public class Address {
  private String streetAddress;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private String zipCode;
  private String country;
}
```

#### 2. Customer, Card, and Account: 
- “Customer” encapsulates the ATM user, “Card” the ATM card, and “Account” can be of two types: checking and savings.

* A checking account is a bank account you can write checks from, or access several other ways, which tends to make it your go-to, daily transaction bank account. A savings account is where you stash funds that you aren't ready to use yet, often with the goal of accumulating more.


```
class Customer {
  String name;
  String email;
  String phone;
  Address address;
  CustomerStatus status;
  
 public bool makeTransaction() {}
}

class Card {
  String cardNumber;
  String customerName;
  Date cardExpiry;
  int pin;
}

class Account {
  int accountNumber;
  double totalBalance;
  double availableBalance;
  
  public int getAvailableBalance() {}
}

class SavingAccount extends Account {
  public double withdrawLimit;
}

class CheckingAccount extends Account {
  public String debitCardNumber;
}
```

#### 4. Bank, ATM, CashDispenser, Keypad, Screen, Printer and DepositSlot
* The ATM will have different components like keypad, screen, etc.

class Bank {}

class ATM {}

class CashDispenser {}
