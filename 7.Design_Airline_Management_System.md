### Design an Airline Management System
* An Airline Management System is a managerial software which targets to control all operations of an airline. 
* Airlines provide transport services for their passengers. 
* They carry or hire aircraft for this purpose. 
* All operations of an airline company are controlled by their airline management system.

#### System Requirements
1. Customer - search for flights for a given date and source/destination airport.
2. Customer - reserve a ticket for any scheduled flight & build a multi-flight itinerary.
3. Customers can make reservations f4. or multiple passengers under one itinerary.
4. Customers can cancel their reservation and itinerary.
5. Users of the system can check flight schedules, their departure time, available seats, arrival time, and other flight details.
6. Only the admin of the system can add new aircrafts, flights, and flight schedules. Admin can cancel any pre-scheduled flight (all stakeholders will be notified).
7.The system should be able to handle the assignment of pilots and crew members to flights.
8.The system should be able to handle payments for reservations.
9. Send notifications to customers whenever a reservation is made/modified or there is an update for their flights.

#### Actor (5)
1. Admin: Responsible for adding new flights and their schedules, canceling any flight, maintaining staff-related work, etc
2. Front desk officer: Will be able to reserve/cancel tickets.
3. Customer: Can view flight schedule, reserve and cancel tickets.
4. Pilot/Crew: Can view their assigned flights and their schedules.
5. System: Mainly responsible for sending notifications regarding itinerary changes, flight status updates, etc.

#### Use Cases
1. Search Flights: To search the flight schedule to find flights for a suitable date and time.
2. Create/Modify/View reservation: To reserve a ticket, cancel it, or view details about the flight or ticket.
3. Assign seats to passengers: To assign seats to passengers for a flight instance with their reservation.
4. Make payment for a reservation: To pay for the reservation.
5. Update flight schedule: To make changes in the flight schedule, and to add or remove any flight.
6. Assign pilots and crew: To assign pilots and crews to flights.

#### Classes
1. Airline
2. Airport
3. Aircraft
4. Flight
5. FlightInstance: ritish Airways flight from London to Tokyo (flight number: BA212) occurs twice a week, each of these occurrences will be considered a separate flight instance in our system.
6. WeeklySchedule and CustomSchedule
7. FlightReservation
8. Itinerary
9. FlightSeat
10. Payment
11. Notification


#### Code

1. Enum & Constants

```
 public enum FlightStatus{
    ACTIVE, SCHEDULED, DELAYED, DEPARTED, LANDED, IN_AIR, ARRIVED, CANCELLED, DIVERTED, UNKNOWN;
}

public enum  PaymentStatus {
    UNPAID, PENDING, COMPLETED, FILLED, DECLINED, CANCELLED, ABANDONED, SETTLING, SETTLED, REFUNDED;
}

public enum  ReservationStatus {
    REQUESTED, PENDING, CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN, CANCELLED, ABANDONED;
}

public enum  SeatClass {
    ECONOMY, ECONOMY_PLUS, PREFERRED_ECONOMY, BUSINESS, FIRST_CLASS
}

public enum  SeatType {
    REGULAR, ACCESSIBLE, EMERGENCY_EXIT, EXTRA_LEG_ROOM;
}

class AccountStatus {
    ACTIVE, CLOSED, CANCELED, BLACKLISTED, BLOCKED;
}

public class Address {
  private String streetAddress;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private String zipCode;
  private String country;
}
```

2. Different People interact with System: Account, Person, Customer & Passenger

```
class Account {
  String id;
  String password;
  AccountStatus status;
  
  public bool resetPassword() {}
}

class Person {
  String name;
  Address address;
  String email;
  String phone;
}

class Customer extends Person {  //Customer has an instance of Passenger
  String frequentFlyer;
  
  public List<Itenary> getItineraries() {}
}

class Passenger {
  String name;
  String passportNumber;
  Date dateOfBirth;
  
  public String getPassportNumber() {}
}
```

3. Top-level classes of System : Airport, Aircraft, Seat, FlightSeat

```
class Airport {
  String name;
  Address address;
  String code;
  
  public List<Flight> getFlights() {}
}

class Aircraft {
  String name;
  String model;
  int manufacturingYear;
  Seat[] seats;
  
  public Seat[] getSeats() {} 
}

class Seat {
  String seatNumber;
  SeatType type;
  SeatClass class;
  
  public SeatType getSeatType() {}
}

class FlightSeat extends Seat {
  float fare;
  String reservationNumber;
  
  float getFare() {}
}
```

4. Flight & Reservation: Flight Schedule classes, Flight, FlightInstance, FlightReservation, Itinerary

```
class WeeklySchedule {
  int dayOfWeek;
  Time departureTime;
}

class CustomSchedule {
  Date customDate;
  Time departureTime;
}

class Flight {
  String flightNumber;
  Airport departure;
  Airport arrival;
  int durationinMinutes;
  
  List<WeeklySchedule> weeklySchedule;
  List<CustomSchedule> customSchedule;
  List<FlightInstance> flightInstances;
  
  List<FlightInstance> getInstance() {}
  
  public bool cancel() {}
  
  public bool addFlightSchedule() {}
}

class FlightInstance {
  Time departureTime;
  String gate;
  FlightStatus status;
  Aircraft aircraft;
  
  public bool cancel() {}
  
  public void updateStatus() {}
}

class FlightReservation {
  String reservationNumber;
  FlightInstance flight;
  Map<Passenger, FlightSeat> seatMap;
  ReservationStatus status;
  Date creationDate;
  
  List<Passenger> getPassenger() {}
}

class Itinerary {
  Airport startingAirport;
  Airport finalAirport;
  Date creationDate;
  List<FlightReservation> flightReservation;
  
  List<FlightReservation> getReservations() {}
  
  public bool makeReservation() {}
  
  public bool makePayment() {}
}
```

5. Notifications

```
class Notification {
  int notificationId;
  Date createdOn;
  String content;
  
  public bool send() {}
}

class EmailNotification extends Notification {
    String email; 
 }
 
 class PostalNotification extends Notification {
    Address address;
 }
 
 class SmsNotification extends Notification {
    String email;
 }
```
