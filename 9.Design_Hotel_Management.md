2. Room
3. Account
4. RoomBooking

#### Code

1. Enums, Datatypes and Constants

```
public enum RoomStyle {
    STANDARD, DELUXE, FAMILY_SUITE, BUSINESS_SUITE;
}

public enum RoomStatus {
    AVAILABLE, RESERVED, OCCUPIED, NOT_AVAILABLE, BEING_SERVICED, OTHER;
}

public enum BookingStatus {
    REQUESTED, PENDING, CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN, CHECKED_OUT, CANCELLED, ABANDONED;
}

public enum AccountStatus {
    ACTIVE, CLOSED, CANCELED, BLACKLISTED, BLOCKED;
}

public enum AccountType {
    MEMBER, GUEST, MANAGER, RECEPTIONIST;
}

public enum PaymentStatus {
    UNPAID, PENDING, COMPLETED, FILLED, DECLINED, CANCELLED, ABANDONED, SETTLING, SETTLED, REFUNDED;
}

public class Address {
  private String streetAddress;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private String zipCode;
  private String country;
}
```

2. Different People Interact with the System: Account, Person, Guest, Receptionist, and Server

```
class Account {
  String id;
  String password;
  AccountStatus status;
  
  public bool resetPassword() {}
}

class Person {
  String name;
  Address address;
  String email;
  String phone;
  AccountType accountType;
}

class Guest extends Person {
  int totalRoomsCheckIn;
  
  public bool createBooking() {}
}

class Receptionist extends Person{
  public bool createBooking() {}
}

class Server extends Person {
  public bool addRoomCharge() {}
}

```
3. Top-Level Classes: Hotel and HotelLocation

```
class HotelLocation {
  String name;
  Address Location;
  
  List<Room> getRooms() {}
}

class Hotel {
  String name;
  
  bool addLocation() {}
}

```

4. Room Entity
```
interface Search {
  public List<Room> searchByRoomStyle(String style);
  public List<Room> searchByStartDate(Date startDate);
  public List<Room> searchByDuration(int days);
}

class Room {
  String roomNumber;
  RoomStyle style;
  RoomStatus status;
  double bookingPrice;
  bool isSmoking;
  
  bool isRoomAvaiable() {}
  
  bool checkIn() {}
  
  bool checkOut() {}
}

class RoomKey {
  String keyId;
  String barcode;
  Date issuedAt;
  bool active;
  bool isMaster;
  
  bool assignRoom() {}
  
  bool isActive() {}
}

class RoomHouseKeeping {
  String description;
  DateTime startDateTime;
  int duration;
  
  bool addHouseKeeping() {}
}


class SelectRoom implements Search {
  private HashMap<String, List<Room>> roomStyle;
  private HashMap<Date, List<Room>> roomStartDate;
  private HashMap<Integer, List<Room>> roomDuration;
  
  public List<Room> findByRoomStyle(String style) {
    return roomStyle.get(style);
  }
  ..
}
```

5. Room services
```
class RoomBooking {
    String reservationNumber;
    Date startDate;
    int durationInDays;
    BookingStatus status;
    DateTime checkIn;
    DateTime checkout;
    
    public RoomBooking fetchDetails() {}
}

class Abstract Roomcharge {
    Date issuedAt;
    
    public bool addInvoiceItem() {}
}

class Amenity extends Roomcharge {
    String name;
    String description;
}

class RoomService extends Roomcharge {
    public bool isChargable;
    public Date requestTime;
}

class KitchenService extends Roomcharge {
    public String description;
}

```

6. Notification

```
class Notification {
    int notificationId;
    Date createdOn;
    String content;
    
    public bool send() {}
}

class PostalNotification entends Notification {
    Address address;
}

class EmailNotification extends Notification {
    String email;
}
```
